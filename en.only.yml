  w_a_amazon: "Leanpub produces and sells PDF, EPUB (for iPad) and MOBI (for Kindle) formats.  We have no lock in, however: you are free to sell the Leanpub-produced files anywhere you want, including on the Kindle store via Amazon's Kindle Direct Publishing program.  We charge you nothing: this is your work; you own it.  (Heck, you can even stick the Leanpub PDFs on Lulu to do print books; authors have done this.)  The way we make our money is that we're confident you will also sell your work on Leanpub (as we pay 90% - 50 cents royalty, which is higher than Amazon or Apple, and we offer a nice storefront with an easy way to automatically distribute updates to your readers)."
  w_a_apple_amazon1: "First off, we think that the Amazon and Apple bookstores are great, and that all finished books should be for sale in both stores.  You can sell your Leanpub book yourself in both stores for $0.  Or you can pay someone like BookBaby or Lulu to do this for you.  We don't try to make any money from you when you sell your book in those stores.  We have no lock-in."
  w_a_apple_amazon2: "Now, we think this makes sense for finished books, but not for in-progress books.  While a Leanpub book is in-progress, we feel it makes sense to only be sold on Leanpub, since that way your readers get automatic updates when you publish new versions, etc.  If you're writing a book and publishing lots of versions of it while you're writing, the last thing you want to deal with is having to update your book in a bunch of storefronts every time you release a new version."
  w_a_apple_amazon3: "However, we don't think that this is necessarily true of the other places that sell ebooks.  While any Leanpub author is free to sell their Leanpub books wherever they want, we feel that storefronts other than Amazon or Apple don't produce much traffic themselves.  (This is true of Leanpub too!)  To promote your book, you need to do the work yourself, with blogging, Twitter, etc.  To concentrate effort (and PageRank), it makes sense to point people at one storefront in your blog posts, tweets, etc.  (We want that place to be Leanpub, obviously -- Amazon and Apple can take care of themselves :)  Also, the reason we structured our royalties the way we do is so that you get a better deal with Leanpub, so you'll want to point at Leanpub so you make the most money from your marketing efforts!"
  w_a_book_file_html: "The Book.txt file just puts the files in order.  (You could write an entire Leanpub book in one file, and then Book.txt would just list that file name.)  The content of the files determines the chapters, sections, etc.  Any<br/># Title at the beginning of a line<br/>becomes an h1 which is a chapter.  Everything after that will be in that chapter until the next<br/># Title at the beginning of a line<br/>which will start the next chapter."
  w_a_broadly: "More broadly, Leanpub is based on the idea that it's absurd that in 2012 there was no good way to write a book. Using a bunch of Markdown files is the best thing we have come up with, but fundamentally most of the ways that people write and publish books today are just barbaric. Proprietary document formats, unreliable programs, no ability to version control your files and see meaningful differences, no way to interact with your readers as you write, etc. We might as well be using typewriters or quill pens.  We're doing our part to help fix this global catastrophe; will you do yours? :)"
  w_a_can_change_price2: "Also, we support variable prices for books, so you can have a low (or free) minimum price, and a higher suggested price.  Then as the book gains traction you can raise the minimum price and/or the suggested price. If your book lives up to the pattern we have seen with multiple books, about a third of people will pay the suggested price, a third will pay the minimum price and a third will pay somewhere in between.  Finally, the odd person will pay more than the suggested price, even with your book having a decent spread between minimum and suggested prices. To optimize revenue and readership, you can run experiments where you lower the minimum price and/or raise the suggested price, and see what happens."
  w_a_can_change_price: "Yes, absolutely. You have complete control over the pricing, and we encourage new models of thinking about book development and pricing.  This is exactly the model we think will work for many books.  Publishing early to get early adopters for feedback and buzz is essential, and setting the price very low at the beginning helps this.  You can change the price whenever you want in either direction, but we recommend starting low and increasing it over time so your early adopters don't feel taken."
  w_a_can_font: "Currently we don't support this, since we need to use open source fonts. If you let us know the exact fonts you're using we'll see if there's anything close, and offer a font choice on the book page."
  w_a_click_convert: "Click the \"Convert Files\" button on the Import page.  This should create Markdown for you.  After this, you can continue wrting your book in Markdown.  (You want to do this import process once, not a bunch of times.  So please don't write in Word and do this process every time you publish or preview -- that will cost you time in the long run.  Learn Markdown; you'll be happier.)"
  w_a_coauthor: "Yes! The preferred way to do this is via the Authors tab in your book's 'Settings' page. This lets you hook up complete author profiles to the book for each of your co-authors, not just their names.  This way, Leanpub is more social and other books the authors write are discovered more easily."
  w_a_convert_72: "No.  You can try putting them in your book at 72 PPI.  We convert them for you.  We're just saying that our automatic conversion may not be as good as what you would do manually."
  w_a_depending_on_size_html: "Depending on the size of your book, there's about a 2 - 10 minute delay.  Chances are if you don't see it in 10 minutes it didn't generate.  We currently write a file called book_generation.log to the preview or published directories, which is primarily for our debugging.  If you have any issue with this, please email %{hello} and attach the book_generation.log file."
  w_a_different_types_html: "Different book types have different default paper sizes.  Each different paper size has a different maximum image width, before your image will bleed over the margin.  Currently all Leanpub books have 1 inch margins. Before we get into specifics there's one really important thing to note: <strong>Watch Your File Sizes!</strong> Before publishing your book, you should look at the sizes of your images in the images directory.  If your images are huge, your book will be too.  This is especially true at 300 PPI -- the images are a lot bigger than you're used to at 72 PPI.  A simple tip to avoid problems is to use JPEG for all photographs, and to use 80% quality or lower.  For figures that are drawings instead of photographs, PNG will look better than JPEG.  You should be fine with PNG for these, since drawings typically produce files that are a lot smaller than photographs."
  w_a_do_all_blogs: "No!  You can start from scratch, or from any content (that you own!) that has an RSS feed.  Any content with an RSS feed can be imported into Leanpub.  This includes different blogging platforms (LiveJournal, Blogger, Typepad, etc) and microblogging platforms (Twitter, etc).  Or, you can start from scratch and write the entire book on Leanpub.  If you import your RSS feed, what happens is that each RSS feed entry (blog post) turns into a file in your Dropbox folder."
  w_a_echeck: "Yes.  However, it may take a few days for you to receive your download link, since that's how long it takes us to get notified by PayPal that the payment was received.  So we recommend using either your PayPal balance or a credit card with PayPal."
  w_a_feedback: "If an author activates the comments feature (and most do!), you can comment on the book's landing page. Authors can also let you know how to email them through their \"About\" section on Leanpub, or in an email you'll receive when you buy the book. Many Leanpub authors will also let you know their Twitter ID on their book landing page, and look forward to hearing your comments and observations that way."
  w_a_formats_publish: "Most Leanpub books are available for you to download in three ebook formats: PDF (for all computers), EPUB (for iPad, Nook, etc.) and MOBI (for Kindle). Some Leanpub books are available in just one or two formats, usually because the author or publisher has put a lot of work into making a highly-crafted book in one particular format. Also, many authors will allow you to read the book online, especially if it is available for free."
  w_a_github_html: "No, it's even easier than that!  We don't download any .git directories or .gitignore files from the folder you use with Dropbox, so your Leanpub Dropbox folder can just be a Git repository that you also push to GitHub!  Whenever you click the publish button we just pull all the new stuff (ignoring .git, .gitignore and any other dot files) from Dropbox, and everything just works.  This is the workflow that Peter Armstrong, Leanpub's co-founder, is doing with his %{leanpublishing} book, and it works fine."
  w_a_h1: "# This is an h1, which becomes a chapter"
  w_a_h2: "## This is an h2, which becomes a section"
  w_a_h3: "### This is an h3, which becomes as subsection"
  w_a_how_become_html: "Great! You can get started by %{sign_up} or by logging in to your existing Leanpub account."
  w_a_how_changes: "As soon as you save the files in the book folder, Dropbox will pick them up (assuming it is running) and the little Dropbox icon will look like a spinning thing.  Once it's back to the green checkmark, Dropbox has the files.  (Or, just wait about 10-20 seconds.)  After this is true, clicking the publish button will trigger book generation with the latest files, since we always get the latest files from Dropbox."
  w_a_how_cover_html: "Just put a file called title_page.png in your book's images folder <strong>and then create a new Preview</strong>. The file should be at 300 pixels per inch (PPI) resolution for best quality.  The actual size of the image varies based on the book style you have chosen. A <strong>technical book</strong> defaults to 8.5 inch x 11 inch  paper.  Your cover page should be exactly 2550 pixels wide and 3300 pixels high at 300 PPI. A <strong>business book</strong> defaults to Digest paper (5.5 inches x 8 inches). Your cover page should be exactly 1650 pixels wide and 2400 pixels high at 300 PPI. A <strong>fiction book</strong> also defaults to 5.5 inches x 8 inches. So your cover page  should be exactly 1650 pixels wide and 2400 pixels high at 300 PPI. Please note that <strong>smaller files and resolution values work too</strong> (for example, 432x648 at 72 PPI), however these images will be scaled and may look fuzzy."
  w_a_how_delete: "As long as your book has no sales, you can delete your book.  The button is at the bottom of the Edit Info page.  If your book has sales, we have to offer it to its existing readers, so you currently can't delete it.  In the future we will presumably add the ability to \"archive\" a book, so that it has no new sales but that its existing readers can still access it."
  w_a_how_money: "We take the money from people who buy your book, and give you 90%, minus a 50 cent flat fee, of it.  (Currently we do PayPal royalty transfers monthly, once an amount of $40 is reached.)  You can tell how many people bought your book: you see a list of every sale (including the date purchased, the total paid and your royalty) on your book sales page."
  w_a_how_register_interest: "Authors automatically get landing pages for books they're working on but haven't published yet. On this landing page you can enter your name and email address to show you're interested in hearing about the book when an early version is available, and you can even indicate (with no obligation) how much you'd be willing to pay for the book when it's published."
  w_a_however_if_save: "However, if your save your image in a 72 PPI format (the default in most programs), it can only be 288 pixels wide (72 PPI * 4 inches = 288 pixels).  If it's wider, it will bleed into the right margin, and if your image is much too big it may not show up at all.  (Please don't use 72 PPI though, since scaling looks like absolute garbage!)"
  w_a_if_import_dropbox: "Yes! They will show up there after the import is complete."
  w_a_if_save: "If you save your image in a 300 PPI format, a 1200 pixel wide image takes 4 inches (1200 pixels / 300 pixel per inch = 4 inches)"
  w_a_ill_try: "I'll try to explain briefly here."
  w_a_image_code: "![This is the Image Caption](images/LeanpubLogo1200x610_300ppi.png)"
  w_a_just_rename: "Just rename it back to Book.txt and then there's no issue :)"
  w_a_leanpubbet_html: "Leanpub has bet the company on Markdown.  Specifically, we claim that Markdown is a better way to write books than Word, OpenOffice, DocBook, anything.  If we're wrong, we're dead.  If we're right, we have an advantage.  Also, Leanpub is based on the idea that publishing while you write is helpful.  We call that idea \"Lean Publishing\"; see %{manifesto} for the full spiel :)"
  w_a_markdown_wysiwyg_html: "We want this too!  Here's the best one we know about currently: %{textseditor}.  It has a Mac and Windows version.  We've tried the Mac version; it's still at an early stage but we think it looks promising.  Please give this a try and give its developer some feedback."
  w_a_marked_html: "You can keep using your favorite text editor and use an external Markdown preview program.  We like the idea of this, since we are very partial to our text editors.  If you use a Mac, you can use %{marked}, which is a standalone a Markdown preview program."
  w_a_marketing: "Right now we don't offer much help!  (We have a bestsellers page, but this won't help you if you've sold no books!)  Now, over time, we'll build the ability to browse books by category, etc, as well as facilitate the social discovery of your book by people who have purchased or liked similar books. For now, however, think of Leanpub as a way of monetizing your existing blog subscribers or Twitter followers.  These people are your audience, and a certain subset of them (our hypothesis is 1% - 5%) are looking for a way to give you money for content you have already written.  Leanpub is the best way of enabling this to happen, since we make that content into a book for you..."
  w_a_mobi_permission: "Yes, you can do that!  You don't need our permission, but you have our blessing! :)"
  w_a_most_blogs_html: "That's true: many blogs are of no interest to anyone but their creators.  Most diaries fall into this category. However, even diaries can be of interest if they are well-written. More generally, many blogs are really either collections of essays or contain 1 or more in-progress books in them.  For example, Paul Graham's <em>Hackers and Painters</em> is a well-regarded book, which is a collection of essays which were originally published on his blog.  In the Leanpub example, both %{SLLhome} and %{VHHhome} are good reading, even though they were produced with no editing by their authors at all.  However, we don't think that most Leanpub books will be produced with no editing.  Instead, we expect that authors will import their blogs as a starting point, and then go through the process of \"curating\" their posts: deleting the \"I just had a great lunch\" type of posts, and editing, rearranging and expanding others.  At the end of this process, you have a manuscript.  The great thing is that you get to sell as you go, and get real feedback from readers (as well as money)..."
  w_a_new_version: "A new version of your book is being generated."
  w_a_next_different: "Next, here is what you need to know for the different Leanpub book types..."
  w_a_no_contents_html: "You need to write your actual content in separate plain text files written with Markdown formatting. The Book.txt file is just a list of files. You can see the sample content for each Leanpub book styles by clickling on the following download links for %{samplebusiness}, %{samplefiction} and %{sampletechnical} books."
  w_a_no_download_link_html: "If you paid by eCheck with PayPal, it may take a few days for you to receive your download link, since that's how long it takes us to get notified by PayPal that the payment was received.  So we recommend using either your PayPal balance or a credit card with PayPal.  If there's any other issue, please email %{hello} and we'll fix it."
  w_a_not_relevant: "You would just delete these posts entirely by deleting the files from your Dropbox folder and removing their names from Book.txt."
  w_a_not_savvy1: "It's a great use of Leanpub.  We're glad to help, but the good news is that we don't need to do anything special here.  The following process will work for you:"
  w_a_not_savvy2: "Create a new Leanpub account & book for your father.  You can use his email address for this."
  w_a_not_savvy3: "Presumably he does not have a Dropbox account.  Assuming this is true, when his email address gets the Dropbox sharing request from Leanpub, have him forward the email to you.  You can either:"
  w_a_not_savvy4: "a) just accept the sharing request using your Dropbox account"
  w_a_not_savvy5: " b) accept the sharing request by creating a new Dropbox account for him, then send your Dropbox account a sharing request on his Dropbox folder"
  w_a_not_savvy6: "Regardless of how you did #2, you're good to go.  You can edit his book on your computer using your Dropbox account.  Whenever you want to publish a new version for him, just login as him and click publish."
  w_a_not_savvy7: "Note that the book will sync with the Dropbox account that accepted the sharing request in #2, so you will see the generated books a bit faster if you just use your Dropbox account, since there won't be an extra Dropbox sync step through an intermediate Dropbox account."
  w_a_not_savvy8_html: "If this doesn't make sense, please email %{hello} and we'll be glad to help."
  w_a_note_important: "Note that it's important to get the size and the resolution of the image right:"
  w_a_our_recommendation: "Our recommendation is to wait until the book is complete before putting it in the Kindle store and iBookstore, but you can do whatever you want.  (Heck, you can even use Leanpub to make your book and put it in the Kindle store without ever selling it on Leanpub.  However, from our perspective, it makes sense to also sell your books on Leanpub since we offer a better royalty structure as well as a nice mechanism to distribute updates to your in-progress books to your readers."
  w_a_pay: "You can buy Leanpub books using a credit card or your PayPal account. Leanpub accepts Visa and MasterCard only. We do not store your credit card data on our servers. Instead, we send this form securely via SSL to our payment processor, PayPal. Specifically, we use PayPal Website Payments Pro to process credit card purchases through our credit card form. Incidentally, this is why we don't accept American Express: we're Canadian, and in Canada, PayPal Website Payments Pro doesn't take American Express. Sorry."
  w_a_peek: "Most Leanpub authors let you download a sample PDF for free from the book landing page, so you can see if you like what they're doing before you commit to buying their work."
  w_a_photo_books: "We don't add much value here.  We recomend Lulu or similar services."
  w_a_preorder: "Not yet, buy you can register your interest in an unpublished book on the book's landing page. Just enter your name and your email address, and when the book is first published, you'll get an email notification that the book is now available."
  w_a_problem_importing_html: "Yes, we can!  If you have any problems importing, please email %{hello} and we'll help you get your blog imported manually."
  w_a_put_files: "Put the HTML file or files into the convert_html folder in your Leanpub book Dropbox folder."
  w_a_readers: "We support three formats: PDF, ePub (for iPad, Sony, Nook, etc.) and MOBI (for Kindle)."
  w_a_review_copies: "The best way to do this is to create coupons for your book. If you go to your book's 'Settings' and select 'Coupons', you can click 'New Coupon' to get started. You can set various parameters for any coupons you create, including coupon price, maximum number of uses, start date and end date. Anyone you give a coupon code to can use it to buy the book from the book's purchase page. If you set the coupon price to zero, they can get the book for free, like a review copy."
  w_a_save_as_html: "Save as HTML from Word by choosing \"Web Page (.htm)\".  Note that you <strong>MUST</strong> choose the option \"Save only display information into HTML\", not the default \"Save entire file into HTML\" option."
  w_a_separate_file: "Leanpub makes a separate file for each post it imports.  So you can just delete the files you don't want from your Leanpub Dropbox folder, and remove them from the Boox.txt file.  Or, if your blogging platform supports custom RSS feeds for categories or dates, you can make an RSS feed containing only the posts you want (by category, say) and then import that feed into Leanpub instead of your full feed."
  w_a_stuck_html: "Sure!  Just email %{hello} and we'll be happy to help you.  (This email address sends email to everyone at Leanpub, so the right person can reply.)"
  w_a_switch_emacs: "Switch to Emacs."
  w_a_text_editor_html: "You can either use a text editor that has a built in Markdown previewer.  On Mac there's %{mou}, and on Windows there's %{markdownpad}."
  w_a_thats_it_html: "That's it!  (See %{markdown} for details on images in Markdown.)  We support PNG, JPEG and GIF formats for images."
  w_a_the_best_thing_html: "The best thing to do is look at the sample content for each Leanpub book style by clicking on the following links to download examples of our %{business}, %{fiction} and %{technical} books."
  w_a_the_chapter: "The chapter structure is separate from the files."
  w_a_three_ways: "There are 3 ways to do this:"
  w_a_update_cover: "Just do a preview or publish and the book page will update with whatever title page is in your book, whether that's a title_page.png or title_page.jpg file you put in manuscript/images, or whether it's the automatically-generated title page we create if you don't provide a title page image."
  w_a_updates: "Yes, you get free updates for as long as the author updates the book!  All readers of a book are treated the same way, regardless of when they bought the book or how much they paid."
  w_a_use_you_stores: "No.  We think authors should do this themselves, since that way they'll have more control over how their book is sold.  Or, if the author does not want to do this, there are services like Lulu and BookBaby that can do this with Leanpub books.  We don't want to be in that business -- for us, it's too labor-intensive and distracting to our core mission, which is making writing, publishing and selling in-progress ebooks as simple and elegant as possible."
  w_a_we_use_300_html: "We use <strong>300 pixels per inch (PPI)</strong> in our books, and we recommend you use that for your images.  Any smaller PPI is scaled up to 300 PPI.  Since we scale up to 300 PPI, your image may look blurry if it's a smaller PPI.  However, the file size will be a lot smaller at a smaller PPI, so this is a tradeoff."
  w_a_were_authors_too: "We're authors too, and the last thing an author wants is to feel like someone else owns their work or controls what they can do with it. It's yours.  We're more than happy for you to make money in as many revenue streams as possible.  As a courtesy to us, we would appreciate it if you left the mention of Leanpub in the second page (to help our marketing) when you sell it elsewhere, but you can remove that too if you want."
  w_a_what_is_leanpub: "Leanpub provides authors and publishers with the best way in the world to write, publish and sell in-progress and completed ebooks. When you buy a Leanpub book, you will get all future updates to the book for free. Updates may include simple improvements like typo fixes, or entirely new chapters, depending on how complete a book is when you buy it. All our books are DRM-free."
  w_a_what_program_html: "Any text editor works.  For programmers, we recommend writing in Emacs, vi or TextMate.  For non-programmers, we recommend %{iawriter} for Mac and iPad.  If all else fails, you can also use TextEdit on Mac or Notepad, Wordpad or %{notepad} on Windows."
  w_a_whatis_variable: "At Leanpub, our 'variable pricing' model allows authors to set a suggested price and a minimum price for their books. As a reader, this allows you to choose how much you want to pay, by moving the pricing slider to the left or to the right when you're making a purchase. It also allows authors to offer their books to readers with different capacities to pay. This means an author can offer a book for a lower minimum price (they can even set the minimum price to zero, making the book available for free), but also encourage readers to pay what the author thinks the book is worth at the suggested price. Many Leanpub readers actually choose to pay more than the minimum and even the suggested price, usually because they want to show extra support for the author. To be clear, you get the same book or package as anyone else, regardless of what you choose to pay."
  w_a_why_buy: "Serial publication (in which books are published chapter-by-chapter) has a long history in the world of fiction, and in the future, we believe serial or \"in-progress\" publishing will become the norm not only for fiction but also for non-fiction. Twenty-first century publishing technologies, specifically related to ebook publication, allow authors to update their books with new chapters and errata fixes easily and instantly. They also allow authors to interact with their audiences in new ways, which can shape their books as they are published in-progress. By purchasing and reading a book before it's finished, you can be part of the process of the book's development, and crucially for some non-fiction books, you can read an author's latest work without having to wait through the arbitrary delays caused by the constraints of earlier forms of publishing."
  w_a_why_buy_here2_html: "1. A Leanpub author gets a 90% minus 50 cents royalty on every Leanpub sale. That is way more than they would get with a traditional publisher, and even more than they get when selling on Amazon or Apple's bookstores. We show you how much money the author gets right on the purchase page; how many other publishers do that?"
  w_a_why_buy_here: "We're here to support authors and we encourage you to buy their books wherever! But here are three reasons to buy their book on Leanpub:"
  w_a_why_buy_here_3: "2. If the book is being published in-progress, you can give the author feedback before the book is done."
  w_a_why_buy_here_4: "3. With in-progress publishing, you can get early access to the author's latest thinking, without having to wait for the full conventional publishing cycle to end. Since you'll receive free updates until the book is completed, you'll always be up to date."
  w_a_why_dashboard1_html: "We create a Leanpub Dashboard for you for three reasons: 1) It's a <Strong>single location</strong> where all your Leanpub purchases are stored, making it easy for you to get at them if you lost the book file or want an updated version. 2) Leanpub books can be updated at any time. Creating a Dashboard for you means you <strong>always have access to the latest version</strong> of a Leanpub book. 3) There are <strong>other features</strong> on your Dashboard to improve your reading experience, like our %{readmill} links."
  w_a_why_dashboard2: "You can access your Dashboard from a link in the email you receive whenever you buy a Leanpub book. Once there, you can set your password, and then you can access your Dashboard by signing in anytime at www.leanpub.com."

  w_coauthor_explanation_3_html: "For now, after you've added a co-author, you need to share the Dropbox folder for the book with them yourself at the %{dropbox} website. We may automate this later."
  w_coauthor_explanation_4: "Co-authors can receive a percentage of the book\'s royalties.  The way the royalty percentages work is as follows: When you add someone as a co-author you propose a royalty percentage that they will receive. You can\'t edit this once it is set; you can only remove the co-author and add them again with a new percentage. (This way, the co-author gets to see, and approve, every new percentage they have been given.) However, since you as the primary author can remove your co-authors at any time, this relationship is built on their trust of you. Please play nice."
  w_coauthor_explanation_5: "Note that as the primary author, your royalty percentage is automatically calculated.  It is 100% minus the royalty percentages of your co-authors. This is the percentage of the book\'s royalties, not the percentage of the revenue."

You assume that for a given price, everyone who said they would pay that price or more will buy the book, and that everyone who said they would pay only less than that price will not buy the book.  (Yes, both those assumptions are fiction!  However, they may be approximately correct.)

(This also works well if you're selling your book while it's in-progress: it rewards the readers who support you early, and helps build a community.)  Or, you could start out with a high price, and then lower the price as the book gets more popular, in order to reach a larger audience.  (Be careful though: you don't want to alienate your early readers, who may feel ripped off.)  So we don't recommend that for anything but the most mass-market book."

  w_publishers: "Publishers"
  w_publishers_blurb: "Leanpub is your ebook solution. Leanpub helps you focus on editing, marketing and print book production, and automates almost everything else."
  w_publishers_blurb2: "Leanpub manuscripts are written in a very simple plain text format called Markdown. You can generate PDF, EPUB and MOBI versions of your books from your manuscripts in one click. Since Leanpub provides a storefront for you, you can also sell them in one click."
  w_publishers_blurb3: "Leanpub also helps with book design, by generating IDML files directly from your Leanpub manuscripts. You can use these files directly with Adobe InDesign, skipping the painful and expensive process of converting Word documents."
  w_learn_more_publisher: "Learn How it Works"
  w_technical_blurb_html: "Leanpub is particularly suited for the authors of computer programming books: one look at our <a href=\"/bestsellers\">bestsellers page</a> will show you how much! Why is this the case? Well, technology changes so quickly that if you're writing a computer programming book, chances are it will be a bit outdated before a print book ended up in a bookstore. Also, if you publish your book while it's in-progress, you get meaningful feedback from your readers and you build buzz among the key early adopters who form the leaders of a community."
  w_bloggers_blurb: "You're sitting on a gold mine of content! With Leanpub, you can import your blog and preview a book in minutes. We turn your RSS feed into a bunch of Markdown files. Then you curate the manuscript, selecting only the relevant files, and optionally editing them. It's like starting a book more than half done! And since you publish while your book is in-progress, you get relevant and timely feedback, just like you do with your blog writing."
  w_leanpub_is_part_html: "Leanpub is part of a movement called <strong>Lean Publishing</strong>, which is the future of publishing. If you're curious about what the big idea is, %{manifesto}."
  w_a_sell_print: "No, we only sell ebooks. However, Leanpub authors are free to sell their content however they like, and some do choose to offer print versions of their books for sale through sites like Lulu."
  w_a_send_to_kindle: "When you purchase a Leanpub book, you'll get a link to your Leanpub Dashboard where you'll find instructions on how to send Leanpub books to your Kindle."
  w_a_traditional_publisher: "At Leanpub you hold the copyright: you can publish it on Leanpub while you are shopping it around.  This way, if you get traction on Leanpub, this will help you build buzz and strengthen your negotiating hand with publishers.  For example, you can ask to keep the e-book rights, since the Leanpub royalty rate of 90% minus the 50 cent flat fee is much better than what most publishers offer!"
  w_a_what_is_lean_publishing_html: "\"Lean Publishing\" is the act of publishing a book while you are writing it</i> and before optionally using the traditional publishing workflow when it is complete. This allows you to get feedback from early readers, and can be a great way of motiviating you to finish a long project, because you don't have to wait until the end for a response from your audience. Leanpub is the best way in the world for authors to do the lean publishing process. To learn more, check out our %{manifesto}."
  w_leanpub_is_the_best_html: "Leanpub is <strong>the best way in the world</strong> to publish a book while you're writing it.  This is true whether you're writing a programming book, a business book or even a cookbook!"

  w_publisher_royalty_note_html: "<strong>You are free to publish your book elsewhere at the same time as you publish it on Leanpub.</strong> However, other platforms may not allow you to publish in two places at once. If you want to try an exclusive service, you can \"retire\" your book on Leanpub any time, and you can also come back and \"unretire\" your book if you conclude you were making more money on Leanpub."
  w_plans_one_time_html: "<strong>Prices are one time charges per book, not subscription charges.</strong> We know that sometimes authors take longer than expected, so we don't want to bill you monthly!"
  w_plan_payment_html: "Payment for all plans is made via credit card or PayPal at the end of the trial period. If you need to pay via purchase order, please email <a href=\"mailto:hello@leanpub.com\">hello@leanpub.com</a> after signing up, and we can work something out."

  w_no_splitting: "With all plans, you earn 90% - 50 cents per book sale in revenue. You are responsible for remitting royalties to your authors based on this amount based on your contract with your authors.  Leanpub does not handle splitting of royalties and remitting royalties to authors for you."
  w_all_same_plan: "When you sign up for a plan, you create your first book. You can add additional books afterward. The plan type is per publisher, not per book: all your books need to be on the same plan. You can upgrade or downgrade your plan anytime. (To upgrade, you just pay the difference on the books you've already created.)"

You have no commitment to buy the book at any price. This is just a service we provide to encourage authors and to let readers get notified when books are first published. Also, you can check the checkbox to share your email address with the author, so that they can email you directly.

We will show you the names and dollar amounts of these potential readers on the %{interested_readers} page. Also, if the potential reader selects a checkbox, we will show you the email address they entered. (We don't verify this email, so please treat it as unverified, and if you have a private email list make sure you have easy unsubscribe options if you add it.) Anyway, when your book is published for the first time, the people who have signed up as interested possible readers are automatically emailed to let them know your book is now available. We don't take payment in advance, but it's good for morale to have people say \"I'd buy that for a dollar\" (or twenty dollars) while you're writing your book but before you've published it. Of course, we encourage you to publish your book while it's in progress according to the %{manifesto_link}, but it's nice to be able to gauge interest in your book while it's still not much more than an idea."

  w_q_need_account: "Q. Since Leanpub books can be updated any time, I will need a place to go where I can always access the latest version of each book I buy. Do you provide me with a personal library for all my books?"
  w_a_need_account: "Yes. When you buy your first Leanpub book, we create an account for you so that you can always access the latest version of every book you buy. After your first purchase, we will email you with download links for the book and a login link for your new account. The download links in the email will always point to the latest version of the book. Also, clicking on the login link will open your Leanpub 'Dashboard', where you can see all your purchases, set your password and change your account settings."
  w_q_print_ready: "Q. Can I use Leanpub to create print-ready PDFs for third-party print-on-demand sites like Lulu and CreateSpace?"
  w_a_print-ready: "Yes, you can! If you go to the 'Actions' page for your book and click on the 'Print' tab, you will have the option to activate this feature. It includes things like alternating page numbers (if you're holding a print book open, the page numbers are above your thumbs) and alternating gutters (the space on the inside edge of each page in a print book, next to the book's spine). You can also choose many of the precise page sizes used by sites like Lulu and CreateSpace for the different sizes of books they produce."
  w_a_print-ready_2_html: "We want Leanpub to be the best way to write and publish books in ebook and in print formats. If you have any suggestions to improve our Print features, please let us know by emailing hello@leanpub.com."

  w_q_need_isbn: "Q. Do I need an ISBN to publish my book on Leanpub?"
  w_a_need_isbn: "No :)"
  w_q_should_isbn: "Q. OK, but should I get an ISBN anyway? Do I need more than one ISBN, for example do I need separate ISBNs for EPUB, MOBI and PDF versions of my book?"
  w_a_should_isbn: "Whether or not to get an ISBN is a tricky question. It can depend on country (some countries charge for ISBNs, others don't), on what you want to do with your book, on how you want to track your book's sales, where and how you want your book reviewed, etc. etc. etc. We have also heard contradictory accounts of whether or not you need a separate ISBN for each ebook format in which you publish your book."
  w_a_should_isbn2: "Briefly, here is the Leanpub position on whether or not you should get an ISBN:"
  w_a_should_isbn3_html: "<strong>You definitely do not need an ISBN until your book is finished</strong>. So while you're writing and publishing your book-in-progress using Leanpub, we recommend you don't worry about ISBNs - just focus on your writing!"
  w_a_should_isbn4_html: "<strong>Start worrying about getting an ISBN only when you discover you absolutely need one</strong>. For example, if you are going to publish your book using other 'channels' like Kindle Direct Publishing or Lulu or CreateSpace, under certain circumstances you will be required to provide an ISBN. At that point, you'll know you need one, and you'll know why, and you can ask whoever's requiring the ISBN what they need."
  w_preview_cover_image_note_html: "If you would like to add a new cover image to your book, please read the instructions for <strong>How do I set a cover image for my book?</strong> on our <a href=\"https://leanpub.com/help/author_faq\">Author FAQ page</a>."
